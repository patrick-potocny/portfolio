### Design & Development

The design of the website draws inspiration from the personal computer "Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV" featured in the popular video game, Fallout 4.The website has been thoughtfully organized to showcase my skills and experience. The portfolio has been divided into four key pages: Home, Projects, About, and Contact, which have been strategically chosen to ensure potential recruiters or employers have access to the most important information. By presenting my past work and achievements on the Projects page, providing a brief introduction of myself on the About page, and including contact information on the Contact page, I aim to create an impressive and compelling digital presence that can effectively communicate my strengths and expertise to potential employers.

This project utilizes several technologies, including React, Next.js, SCSS and TypeScript. Each technology was chosen carefully to ensure the application is highly efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

Next.js was chosen as the primary framework for this project because of its impressive speed, image optimization, and mainly built-in pre-rendering options like SSG (Static Site Generation). Given that one of the primary goals of the website is to showcase the owner's previous work, it is essential to keep the website updated over time. Utilizing SSG, during the build process, we can automatically generate all the pages for every project and its corresponding case study using a markdown file. This approach helps to ensure that the website remains up-to-date without requiring a lot of manual effort. Additionally, using static site generation can improve website performance and reduce page load times, resulting in a better user experience.

React was selected as the front-end library for this project because of its declarative syntax, which allows me to create reusable components that can be easily rendered and updated on the fly. React also facilitates the creation of highly interactive user interfaces, which was crucial for the success of this project.

To style the app, SCSS modules were utilized for each component to avoid class name collisions, as the app became increasingly complex. SCSS is a popular preprocessor for CSS that allows you to write CSS with variables, mixins, and more advanced features, making it easier to maintain and scale.
